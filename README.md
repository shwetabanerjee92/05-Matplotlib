# Python Matplotlib: Pyber

## Background
The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Our objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, we will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

## Pyber Analysis

1. On the bases on the Bubble plot, we can understand that the "Urban" cities have the maximum no of driver count per city with low fares followed by "Suburban" and then "Rural
2. Although in "Rural" areas, there is less number of drivers their average fare per ride is much more than the "Suburban" and "Urban" areas.
3. Also with the maximum number Total Fares by City Type (62.7%), Total Rides by City (68.4%) and Total Drivers by City (86.7%)  it makes sense to implement the Pyber first in the "Urban" areas as it has the maximum amount of opportunities available thus would have a higher success rate.
