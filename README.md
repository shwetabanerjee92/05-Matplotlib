# Pyber Analysis

1. On the bases on the Bubble plot, we can understand that the "Urban" cities have the maximum no of driver count per city with low fares followed by "Suburban" and then "Rural
2. Although in "Rural" areas, there is less number of drivers their average fare per ride is much more than the "Suburban" and "Urban" areas.
3. Also with the maximum number Total Fares by City Type (62.7%), Total Rides by City (68.4%) and Total Drivers by City (86.7%)  it makes sense to implement the Pyber first in the "Urban" areas as it has the maximum amount of opportunities available thus would have a higher success rate.
